AIM : Design a class named Account that contains:
     •A private int data field namedid for the account (default 0).
     •A private double data field named balance for the account (default 0).
     •A  private  double  data  field  named  annualInterestRate  that  stores  
      the  currentinterest rate (default 0).
      Assume all accounts have the same interest rate.
     •A  private  Date  data  field  named  dateCreated  that  stores  the  
      date  when  theaccount was created.
     •A no-arg constructor that creates a default account.
     •A constructor that creates an account with the specified id and initial 
      balance.
     •The accessor and mutator methods for id, balance, and annualInterestRate.
     •The accessor method for dateCreated.
     •A method named getMonthlyInterestRate() that returns the monthlyinterest 
      rate.
     •A method named getMonthlyInterest() that returns the monthly interest.
     •A method named withdraw that withdraws a specified amount from theaccount.
     •A method named deposit that deposits aspecified amount to the account.*/
